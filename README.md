## web and mobile Developer 👨🏽‍💻

**Developer, designer, I do mainly web development**, however I also have skills in mobile development with the Google Flutter framework, I like to learn new things, I like to solve problems. However I'm rather perfectionist that's my default because ``Done is better than perfect``, so I'm continuously learning, always trying to get out of my comfort zone and take challenges.

 PHP / JS / TypeScript / Dart / Flutter / Angular / React / Integration
